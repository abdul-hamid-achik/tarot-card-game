# Testing Checklist

Comprehensive testing guide for the game implementation.

## Priority System Tests

### ✅ Priority Management
- [ ] Defender gets priority at round start
- [ ] Priority passes correctly after unit play
- [ ] Priority stays with player after Burst spell
- [ ] Priority passes after Fast/Slow spell

### ✅ Attack Token System
- [ ] Only attack token owner can attack
- [ ] Attack token switches each round
- [ ] Rally allows multiple attacks

## Spell Stack Tests

### ✅ Spell Speed Validation
- [ ] Slow spells can't be played in combat
- [ ] Focus spells can't be played in combat
- [ ] Fast spells can respond to stack
- [ ] Burst spells resolve immediately
- [ ] Stack resolves in LIFO order

### ✅ Stack Resolution
- [ ] Fast spells create stack
- [ ] Slow spells create stack
- [ ] Burst/Focus don't create stack
- [ ] Stack resolves after two passes

## Combat Tests

### ✅ Combat Flow
- [ ] Attack declaration creates stack
- [ ] Defender can respond before blocking
- [ ] Blockers lock in correctly
- [ ] Combat damage calculates properly
- [ ] Overwhelm works correctly

### ✅ Combat Timing
- [ ] Combat triggers after main phase
- [ ] Combat requires both players to pass
- [ ] Combat ends round correctly

## Round Flow Tests

### ✅ Resource Management
- [ ] Mana increments correctly
- [ ] Spell mana carries over (max 3)
- [ ] Attack token switches each round
- [ ] Cards draw at round start

### ✅ Phase Transitions
- [ ] Two passes end round/phase correctly
- [ ] Combat phase triggers appropriately
- [ ] Round cleanup works properly

## Integration Tests

### ✅ Frontend Integration
- [ ] FSM state reflects in UI
- [ ] Priority indicators work correctly
- [ ] Action buttons enable/disable properly
- [ ] State synchronization works

### ✅ Backend Integration
- [ ] WebSocket actions validate against FSM
- [ ] Database state matches FSM state
- [ ] Error handling for invalid actions

### ✅ Multiplayer Tests
- [ ] Priority passing works for both players
- [ ] Combat resolution is consistent
- [ ] State updates broadcast correctly

## Performance Tests

### ✅ State Machine Performance
- [ ] State transitions under 10ms
- [ ] Large game states don't cause lag
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable

### ✅ Network Performance
- [ ] WebSocket messages under 50ms
- [ ] State sync doesn't cause delays
- [ ] Reconnection handling works

## Edge Cases

### ✅ Error Conditions
- [ ] Invalid actions are rejected
- [ ] Network disconnects handled gracefully
- [ ] Corrupted state recovery

### ✅ Game State Edge Cases
- [ ] Maximum mana handling
- [ ] Full hand scenarios
- [ ] Combat with no valid targets

## Debug & Monitoring

### ✅ Logging
- [ ] FSM transitions logged
- [ ] Action validation logged
- [ ] Error conditions logged

### ✅ Monitoring
- [ ] Game completion rates tracked
- [ ] Error rates monitored
- [ ] Performance metrics collected

## Test Automation

### ✅ Unit Tests
- [ ] FSM transition tests

- [ ] Calculation tests

### ✅ Integration Tests
- [ ] Full game flow tests
- [ ] Multiplayer scenario tests
- [ ] Error recovery tests

### ✅ E2E Tests
- [ ] Complete game playthrough
- [ ] Different victory conditions
- [ ] Various deck compositions

## Browser Compatibility

### ✅ Desktop Browsers
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

### ✅ Mobile Browsers
- [ ] iOS Safari
- [ ] Chrome Mobile
- [ ] Firefox Mobile

## Accessibility Tests

- [ ] Focus management works
- [ ] Screen reader support

### ✅ Visual Accessibility
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Text scaling works
