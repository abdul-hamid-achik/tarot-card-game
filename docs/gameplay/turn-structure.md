# Turn Structure & Timing

Phases: Draw → Main → Combat → End.

- Single reaction window after board-changing actions
  - Non-active may play 1 Fast, then active may play 1 Fast; resolve and close
  - No continuous stack / ping-pong
- Deterministic triggers: non-active first; tie-break with stable IDs

See details in `GAMEPLAY.md` §9.1 and §11.
