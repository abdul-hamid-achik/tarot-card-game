# AI Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AI Infinite Loop
**Problem**: AI was continuously drawing and placing cards in an infinite loop
**Solution**: 
- Added `useRef` to track last AI turn with a unique key (`${activePlayer}-${turn}`)
- Only execute AI logic if it's a new turn (not a repeat)
- Clear timeouts properly to prevent multiple executions

### 2. Incorrect Simulator References
**Problem**: API route was using non-existent `LaneGameSimulator`
**Solution**: 
- Updated to use `TarotSimulator` which exists in the codebase
- Fixed all method calls to match the actual simulator API

### 3. AI Controller Using Wrong Properties
**Problem**: AI was looking for `board` property but the new system uses `bench` and `battlefield`
**Solution**:
- Updated AI to check `bench` for available units
- Updated board evaluation to check both `bench` and `battlefield`
- Fixed unit finding logic to search both zones

## Implementation Details

### Turn Management (GameBoard.tsx)
```typescript
const aiTimerRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
const lastAITurn = useRef<string>('');

// Unique turn key prevents re-execution
const turnKey = `${currentMatch.activePlayer}-${currentMatch.turn}`;
if (isAITurn && turnKey !== lastAITurn.current) {
  lastAITurn.current = turnKey;
  // Execute AI logic
}
```

### LoR-Style Board Layout
- **Bench (Reading Table)**: 6 slots for units not in combat
- **Battlefield (Manifestation)**: 6 slots for attacking/blocking units
- Units move from bench â†’ battlefield when attacking
- Units return to bench after combat

## Testing Steps
1. Start a new game
2. Play cards to the bench
3. Pass turn to AI
4. Verify AI:
   - Plays cards if it has mana
   - Doesn't get stuck in loops
   - Properly ends its turn
   - Moves units between bench/battlefield when attacking

## Next Steps
- Implement proper drag-drop for card repositioning
- Add attack commitment animations
- Implement blocking phase with proper UI
